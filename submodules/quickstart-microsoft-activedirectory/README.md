# quickstart-microsoft-activedirectory

This Quick Start deploys Microsoft Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) on the AWS cloud. AD DS and Domain Name Server (DNS) are core Windows services that provide the foundation for many Microsoft-based solutions for the enterprise, including Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Exchange, and .NET Framework applications. The Quick Start is designed for organizations running workloads in the AWS cloud that require secure, low-latency connectivity to AD DS and DNS services.
